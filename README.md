PongoKit
========

An SDK for pongoOS. This is currently pretty much experimental.

You can build the module at example/ with an iOS cross-compiler on Linux or a Mac. Refer to scripts/ to see how to load modules.

**This API is not final and we do not currently provide any API or ABI stability guarantees across pongoOS releases.**
